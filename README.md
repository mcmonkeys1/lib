## About

This repository contains all of the necessary code to start a trading post of your own.

You can access the code for our frontend [here](https://github.com/useverto/verto).

> Important Notice: Verto is in its Alpha stage. If you have a suggestion, idea, or find a bug, please report it! The Verto team will not be held accountable for any funds lost.

## Guide

Deploying your own trading post is extremely easy! In this short guide, we'll show you exactly what to do.

### Token Staking

To ensure the integrity of the Verto Trading Post Network, you'll need to purchase and stake `VRT` tokens. The more tokens you stake, the higher your reputation will be. If a trading post begins acting malicious, the Verto DAO will be able to vote to slash that trading post's stake.

You can purchase `VRT` with `AR` on [Verto](https://verto.exchange/trade)!

To stake, you need to lock tokens in the vault on our [Community](https://community.xyz/#aALHIrtzQzy88AhH9uVGxr2GrdSngu2x1CYbyi50JaA/vault).

> Note: You must use configure the trading post to use the same wallet as the one you have staked currency in.

#### Reputation

As mentioned above, you'll need to stake `VRT` tokens to be a trading post. A trading post's reputation is determined by the following factors:

- Amount of stake (weighted at 50%)
  - A medium that the DAO can hold the trading post accountable for
- Amount of time staked (weighted at 33%)
  - Provides proof of dedication to the platform
- Balance (weighted at 17%)
  - Provides a rough estimation for the popularity of the trading post

### Getting Started

#### Configuration

Before deploying a trading post, you'll want to properly configure the system. You'll also need to drag & drop your keyfile to the root of this repository and make sure the name of the file is `arweave.json`.

##### verto.config.json

The `verto.config.json` file is where the majority of your configuration will lie. You'll need to create this file before you can run a trading post. As seen in the config.example.json file, it must contain the following information:

```json
{
  "genesis": {
    "acceptedTokens": [
      "fE2OcfjlS-sHqG5K8QvxE8wHtcqKxS-YV0bDEgxo-eI",
      "FcM-QQpfcD0xTTzr8u4Su9QCgcvRx_JH4JSCQoFi6Ck"
    ],
    "tradeFee": 0.01,
    "publicURL": "your-trading-post-domain.com",
    "version": "0.2.0"
  },
  "database": "./path/to/a/verto.db",
  "api": {
    "port": 8080,
    "host": "localhost"
  }
}
```

- acceptedTokens: This is the place for you to add all of the tokens you want your trading post to accept and exchange. To get a list of tokens officially supported, see https://verto.exchange/gallery. You can even add support for tokens not on that list!
- tradeFee: This is the fee that your trading post will take when an exchange is made. You get to choose your own fee, but know that others may try to compete with lower fees!
- publicURL: You'll need to add the publically available domain/IP that the trading post API will be accessible from in this variable. To ensure the uptime of a trading post, each trading post hosts its own API for the frontend to ping whenever a trade is initiated.
- version: The current trading post version.
- database: This field is where your database will be created.
- api: If you want to modify the host and port of the API, you can do it in these variables.

> As of now, this configuration cannot be changed after the genesis transaction of a trading post. We're hoping to add support for configuration changes soon!

#### Running the Trading Post

##### Install pre-built binaries

The trading post is distributed as standalone binaries for your operating system.
Install these binaries via our installers -

**Linux**

```shell script
curl -fsSL https://verto.exchange/i/linux | sh
```

**MacOS**

```shell script
curl -fsSL https://verto.exchange/i/mac | sh
```

**Windows**

```shell script
iwr https://verto.exchange/i/windows | iex
```

It will download releases aand unzip artifacts. You can add the binary to your PATH env variable by following the instructions after installation.

Now, create a trading post config

```shell script
verto init
```

and quick start your trading post with -

```shell script
verto -k keyfile.json
```

You've successfully started a verto trading post! :smile:

You can also [set up a reverse proxy](./docs/PROXY.md) with `nginx`.

##### Build from source

> It is recommended to use pre-built production binaries when spinning up a trading post.

In order to build a trading post from source, make sure you have `git` and `node` installed on your machine.

Clone the repo and make it your working directory

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/useverto/trading-post
cd trading-post
```

Using your favourite package manager, download the required dependencies

```shell script
# using yarn
yarn
# using npm
npm i
```

Now, it's time to build the trading post! It is as simple as,

```shell script
yarn prod
```

Awesome! You've successfully built the trading post!
It is now avaliable at `./dist/verto.js`

Create a verto configuration for your trading post using the below command.

```shell script
node ./dist/verto.js init
```

and finally start the trading post! :smile:

```shell script
node ./dist/verto.js --key-file /path/to/your/keyfile.json
```

Now you can sit back and enjoy while the trading post greets you with some colourful logs.

#### Conclusion

After you've started the trading post, you might want to [set up a reverse proxy](./docs/PROXY.md) for the trading post API.

And that's it! Your trading post will proceed to send a genesis transaction to the exchange wallet, which will officially list it on the [gallery](https://verto.exchange/gallery)!
